Steps:
- Please run populate doodle_polls\populatedb\out\artifacts\populatedb_jar\populate_db.bar, that is small java app including prepared statments that will create and populate MySQL database.
- Please check your DB.

Technology stack:
- Java 8, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring data, MySQL
- I was thining about this technology stack as a fastest way to complete this assigment
- I have more expirience with SQL DBs that NoSQL, and becasue i choose mySQL DB

Things to improve:
- Better handling of Blob data, description field class Poll
- Change the way of storing "preferences" integer array
- Better Docker configuration
- Task is not too hard, but that I was given more time to solve it I would have tried to use NO SQL database and  I would be more dedicated to configure docker-compose.yml file
